# Hide Youtube Comment Pictures

A simple addon that hides users profile pictures in the youtube comment section. Not finished and is very buggy

# Build
Install from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mihasket/hide-yt-comment-pictures
```

Build the addon with `web-ext`
```bash
web-ext build
```

# TODO
- Implement a different way to hide pictures
- Currently only works for the first loaded comments
